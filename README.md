Some Pre-development Mockups made with *Sketch* to get a sense of what I wanted:

This is my first project in React and in React Native.
It was hard but rewarding :)

**Currently only running in iOS.**

## Installing
Get in the root folder, and run `npm install`.

If you don't have React Native Installed, start [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)

## Running
It's an **iOS only** App for now, so you can run it only with xcode on OSX.
